This is a template Jupyter Notebook for the purpose of building CNNs for image classifications. My first to projects in computer vision were image classification problems and I noticed that overall the steps are essentially the same. Firstly we define the filepaths for the dataset/s. Next we load the data and prepare it by doing transformations and converting them into tensors. We also should check the validity of the images as some could be corrupted. Once the data has been prepared and validated, the CNN model is built with or without the use of a pre-trained CNN. Then the model is trained and validated with the data and in return we can inspect the graphs to judge whether the model is a suitable fit.
